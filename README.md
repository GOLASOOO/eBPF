# Hello!
Hi, I'm Gonza and I've created this repo as part of my final degree thesis.
Currently I have no idea on what it will be, but I want it to be about eBPF as recomended by internship tutor, Guille.

I enjoy cybersecurity and this may be a great oportunity to learn about a powerful tool that may be used later at projects!

## My goals and roadmap
To be fully honest, I have no idea of what I'll be doing. My plan for now is to study ``Learning eBPF`` by Liz Rice to learn the fundamentals about this technology and then, later on start working with tools such as ``Cilium``, ``Hubble`` or ``Parca``.

I want to make this repo as some kind of notes that will help new people into this technology. Somethings may be wrong, beware!
